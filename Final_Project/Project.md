# A Representation of the Effects of Total Failure of the Stevenson Dam
## *Dylan Hamme, 2021*

***Introduction***
<br>
With the frequency and intensity of summer storms increasing due to a rise in global temperature, the stress put on dams around the world is increasing. Many U.S. dams are relatively old, with many being over a century old since initially being built. Concerns of failure of these often neglected dams has been rising in recent years with the expectancy of increased stresses caused by rising global temperatures. The Stevenson Dam on the Housatonic River in Western Connecticut is no exception. The dam was originally built in 1917 with a power-house to accommodate the turbine used for energy production. Repairs and upgrades have been made throughout the century, specifically in 1936, 1951, 1958, 1995, and 1999. A recent article by Heather Mongilio brought the dangers of dated dams to my attention as she states “failures have occurred in every state, with at least 173 failures between 2005 and 2013… Approximately 15,500 of (U.S. Dams) are classified as high hazard, meaning in the case of failure, at least one life could be lost”.

***Overview***
This is a display of a the simulated effects on the Lower Housatonic Valley after a theoretical total failure of the Stevenson Dam on the Housatonic River. The Dam creates Lake Zoar, a Lake with 27 Miles of shoreline.
