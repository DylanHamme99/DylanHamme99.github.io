# I'd like to do an analysis of the energy sources in Connecticut. First, I will create a map of the locations of each power plant in the state. Then, I want to create a representation of what the power grid would look like if all the natural gas powerplants were removed in the state. This will require a shapefile of the counties or towns as well as an estimation of their total power supply. I want to create a chloropleth based on how much power each town/county recieves after removal of power plants. The main map of this project will entail replacing those removed natural gas power plants with Wind turbines and solar power plants. This will require further estimation of how much energy is produced at each of these stations. A buffer/distance estimate will be used to determine which areas recieve power first, and calculations will be made to see what percentage of power is distributed across counties.
