## What Are the Dangers of Powerplants and Whom Do They Affect?

***Introduction:*** 
The dangers of different kinds of powerplants has been of topic of research for a few decades. It is known that some release contaminants into the atmosphere through the burning of fuels like petroleum and natural gas, and research has also shown patterns that these are routinely placed in areas of poverty. This is  tested using public survey data compared to the locations of different types of powerplants across Connecticut.

**Overview:**
This is purely a display of the data that will be used to make an analysis: powerplant types and locations and median household incomes of each available blockgroup in Connecticut. The statewide median household income is provided for comparison to future data.

**Placement Relative to Income:**
There is no clear data based on research that looks at how far reaching the potential hazards of air contaminants from fuel powerplants are, but this is a necassary aspect of deciding which blockgroups are affected by powerplants. To get an approximate estimate of the affected area, a zone of a one mile radius was placed around every natural gas or petroleum burning plant and everyblock group that fell inside of the one mile zone was considered affected. The data for every blockgroup was then collected and the median household income of the affected blockgroups was calculated. This can be compared to the statewide median.
