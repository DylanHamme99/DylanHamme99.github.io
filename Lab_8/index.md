# Lab 8, Creating a Bivariate Map Using R and QGIS
## Dylan Hamme, 2021

This lab required downloading data from the American Community Survey (ACS) via "get_acs()" and creating a bivariate map of Baltimore city based on median income and the percent population that is white by census tract. This was followed by creating the same bivariate map with a county of my choice. I chose Hartford County in Connecticut, and used the percent black population and changed to color pallete to test my own ability. This can all be found in the knitted markdown file below:
